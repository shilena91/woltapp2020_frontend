# woltapp2020

I decided to do Wolt's assignment for Front-end internship position summer 2020 in Swift and show it on an iOS app.

I have no experience in Swift and iOS development. Firstly, I listed the steps that need to be done in this project. Secondly I started watching tutorials that I could find online in order to do those steps. After 1 day of watching videos I came up with this. Since all given restaurants are in Helsinki,  I don't need to sort it based on city. In my opinion available status and location are important factors when I search for a restaurant as an user. So at this point, my app sortes and shows restaurants with online "True" status and have location closer to user first.

There are still some issues with the UI design as you can see. For example restaurant's images are not in same size as I want. I would fix it when I have more knowledge about swift and iOS. Also I will add a sorting button to sort restaurants in alphabetical order. Feel free to provide solutions for those.
